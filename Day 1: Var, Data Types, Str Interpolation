VARIABLES: 
- A place where you can store program data. 

var name = "David" //Creating a variable 
let birthYear = 2002 //Creating a constant

- You can modify variables but you cannot modify constants. 

MULTI-LINE STRINGS:

var str1 = """
This goes 
over multiple
lines
"""

// If you only want multi-line strings to format your code neatly, and you don't want those line breaks to actually be in your string, 
//end each line with a "\"

var str2 = """
This goes \
over multiple \
lines
"""
